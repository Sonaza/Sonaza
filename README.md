### Hello

My name is Teemu and I am a programmer thing or something. I've worked at Tremedia Ky since January 2025 as a web developer.

I previously worked at Frozenbyte Oy as a game engine, console and general gameplay programmer.

I graduated from Kajaani University of Applied Sciences in December 2014 with a bachelor's degree in information technology (fin. tietojenkäsittelyn tradenomi, peliala) and specifically game and game engine programming. 

I like penguins 🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧

And cats 🐈🐈🐈🐈
