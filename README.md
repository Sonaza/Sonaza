### Hello

My name is Teemu and I am a game programmer thing or something. I've worked at Frozenbyte Oy since August 2016 as an engine, console and general gameplay programmer.

I graduated from Kajaani University of Applied Sciences in December 2014 with a bachelor's degree in information technology (fin. tietojenkäsittelyn tradenomi, peliala) and specifically game and game engine programming. My thesis was on component-based object management in game development which is a central part of modern game engines. 

I like penguins 🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧

And cats 🐈🐈🐈🐈
